s:608:"<pre>I would now like to ask you to do a rather different task <br />We would like to know how good or bad your health was <u>BEFORE YOUR HIP FRACTURE</u> <br />To help you say how good or bad your health state is I'd like you to try to picture in your mind a scale that looks
a bit like a thermometer. The best health state you can imagine is marked 100 (one hundred) at the top of the
scale and the worst state you can imagine is marked 0 (zero) at the bottom.<br />I would now like you to tell me the point on this scale where you would put your own health state right BEFORE
YOUR HIP FRACTURE.</pre>";
